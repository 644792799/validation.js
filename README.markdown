# Validation.js 1.0.0

[Examples and Documentation](http://i-like-robots.github.com/Form-Validation/)

Standalone, understandable Javascript form validation. No gimmicks, fluff or feature bloat. Includes methods to check for value
present/empty, email address format, URLs, custom expressions and comprehensive date validation. Validatating forms isn't fun but hopefully
Validation.js makes it less of a pain.
