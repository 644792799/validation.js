# Validation.js 1.1.0

[Examples and Documentation](http://i-like-robots.github.com/Form-Validation/)

Standalone, understandable Javascript form validation. No gimmicks, fluff or feature bloat. Includes methods to check for value present/empty; email
addresses, URLs and custom expressions; Comprehensive date validation; string lenghs and dealing with numbers. Validatating forms isn't fun but hopefully
Validation.js makes it less of a pain.
